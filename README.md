## Running React on Replit

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

This Repl contains a series of tech test examples for React interviews. Each example in the `examples` folder contains a test question and a possible implementation.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Navigate to the `examples` folder.
- Select an example folder.
- Hit run.
- You can now view the example in your browser and explore the code.

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)
